      <h1>All About Us</h1>
        <p>We here at Pet Palace are a grocery store for your furry friends. Founded in 2018, our founder wanted a cost friendly one-stop-shop for all the things you need for your non-human family members. We stock supplies for all types of animals: Dogs, Cats, Birds, Rabbits, Ferrits, Fish and more! Our owners love pets and want to take of yours, so we also offer small vet services as well as a full service groomers! If your pet just needs a cleaning we also have a self service shower station.  </p>
