                <h3>Clay Preparation</h3>
                <p class="pright">
                    &quot;All Brayshaw pottery is made from a white earthenware clay. It must be de-aired, kneaded, and weighed out for the thrower.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Throwing
                </h3>
                <p class="pright">
                    Expertly centred on the wheel, the clay is slowly drawn up into the desired shape. Once the desired shape has been achieved, it will be set aside to dry to a leathery texture where it can be decorated. Drying may take hours or days, depending on the size of the piece, the weather, and other atmospheric conditions.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Pre-Decoration
                </h3>
                <p class="pright">
                    Before the piece can be decorated, it may have a handle attached, it may have a foot-ring cut into it’s base, it may be joined together with another piece, have drainage holes cut out or even have feet attached! Finally it will be smoothed down by sponge. &quot;
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Decoration
                </h3>
                <p class="pright">
                    Typically, a piece will receive a base coat of colour, be allowed to dry, and then desired colour is applied either with a cut sponge or by brush Again it is set aside for a short period. Further coats are then applied to achieve the desired colour and texture and rims will be banded with colour. After yet another period of drying any scratching will take place. This is where lines are cut back into the inherent white colour of the clay and is known as the scraffitto technique. Scraffitto technique, Finally, outlines will be painted on.<br>

                <h3>Firing</h3>
                <p class="pright">
                    The now decorated piece is then transferred into the warm environment of the Kiln Rooms. Here it will sit untouched for anything up to two weeks to dry out completely.
                </p>
                <p class="pright">
                    It then undergoes its first kiln firing, known as the bisque firing, to 1050 degrees Celsius. This hardens the pot to withstand the glazing process. When the kiln cools down, the piece will be dipped in a white, lead-free glaze.
                </p>
                <p class="pright">
                    A second firing then follows, this time to 1150 degrees Celsius. The white glaze becomes transparent, giving the piece it’s hard, glass-like texture. Finally it will be closely checked for quality in both shape and colouring. Checked for quality in both shape and colouring.
                </p>
                <p class="pright">
                    In most cases all the processes are now complete. Exceptions are lamps, where fittings must be attached, and mirror frames where the mirror glass must be installed.
                </p>

                <p class="pright">
                    It will then be wrapped, packed, and
                    despatched to its new home.To ensure the continued
                    success of the pottery, methods of production are
                    constantly under review to source the best materials,
                    equipment and humanly satisfying methods.

                </p>

                <p class="pright">In total a piece may be handled up to 40 times during its making and can take up to three weeks to complete. </p>
